DCPU-16 Hardware Info:
	Name: K8581 - Sound Interface Device
	ID: 0x140fd321, Version: 0x8581
	Manufacturer: 0x0c72a5cd (KULOG_HW)


Description:
	The Kulog K8581 is a sophisticated sound interface device which includes the
	following features:
	
	- 4 voices
	- 4 different waveforms (sawtooth, triangle, square, and noise)
	- 4 waveform filters (highpass, lowpass, bandpass and NOTCH reject)
	- 16 volume levels
	- ADSR envelope generator
	- Frequencies from 0 - 4369Hz


Interrupt behaviour:
	When the K8581 recieves a HWI interrupt, it reads the A register and performs one of
	the following actions:


SET REGISTERS:
==========================================================================================

0x0000-0x0003: SET_ENVELOPE_(1-4)
	Reads the B register, which should be in the format aaaaddddssssrrrr. Sets the
	voice's envelope where a=attack rate, d=decay rate, s=sustain volume and
	r=release rate.
	a, d and r times (in milliseconds) are calculated by the formula 2^x where x is
	the a, d or r value.
	s is the sustain volume, and can be set to higher than the volume set by
	SET_ATTACK_VOLUMES.

0x0004: SET_ATTACK_VOLUMES
	Reads the B register, which must be in the format aaaabbbbccccdddd. Each nybble of the
	B register corresponds to a voice's attack volume.

0x0005: SET_SQUARE_DUTIES
	Reads the B register, which must be in the format aaaabbbbccccdddd. Each nybble
	of the B register sets the corresponding voice's square wave duty level.

0x0006-0x0009: SET_FREQUENCY_(1-4)
	Reads the B register, and sets the frequency of the voice to B/0xF

0x000A: SET_HIGHPASS_CUTOFF
	Reads the B register, and sets the highpass cutoff frequency to B/0xF

0x000B: SET_LOWPASS_CUTOFF
	Reads the B register, and sets the lowpass cutoff frequency to B/0xF

0x000C: SET_FILTER_RES_VOICES
	Reads the B register, which must be in the format rrrrrrrr00ppffff. The lower
	4 bits define which voices should be filtered. The 'p' bits define which filters
	should be applied, and use the following values:

		00=Bandpass filter (reduces levels above lowpass cutoff and below highpass
		cutoff)
		01=Highpass filter (reduces levels above lowpass cutoff)
		10=Lowpass filter (reduces levels below highpass cutoff)
		11=NOTCH reject filter (reduces levels between highpass and lowpass)

	The upper 8 bits define the resonance value of the filter.

0x000D: SET_WAVEFORM_PLAY_STOP
	Reads the B register, which must be in format sssseeeeaabbccdd. Each s is a
	voice's start (key on) bit, and each e is a voice's end (key off) bit.
	The lower 8 bits define which waveforms are used for the 4 voices. They use the
	following values: 

		00=Square
		01=Triangle
		10=Sawtooth
		11=Noise.

	When a voice's start bit is set, the voice will start playing its waveform at the
	frequency set by SET_FREQUENCY_(1-4). It's volume will rise to the attack volume
	set by SET_ATTACK_VOLUMES at the rate set by SET_ENVELOPE_(1-4), The volume will
	then decrease (or increase) to the sustain volume at the rate of the
	decay setting, and continue playing the voice at the sustain volume, until the 
	voice's end bit is set.

	When a voice's end bit is set, the voice's volume will decrease to zero at the
	release rate set by SET_ENVELOPE_(1-4).
